This repository contains my compiled activities, exercises, and projects for the CMPLE class. It reflects my continuous learning and development in Python programming as well as my understanding of basic electronics concepts. Through this repository, I demonstrate how I apply classroom lessons into practical outputs while improving my logical thinking, problem-solving skills, and code organization. All files and folders are structured to show my progress throughout the course and to maintain clarity, consistency, and good coding practices.

Organized weekly folders to clearly document my progress and learning development

Python programs covering fundamental topics such as variables, conditionals, loops, functions, and basic encryption

Activities related to electronics concepts including resistors, capacitors, and inductance

Emphasis on readable, well-structured code and proper documentation

A reflection of my effort, discipline, and commitment to learning throughout the CMPLE course
